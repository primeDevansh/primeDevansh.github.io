Let me tell you about a flight I'll never forget. It was a trip to Malaysia when I was about 10 or 11 years old. I remember feeling curious about everything around me, including the life vests tucked beneath our seats. So, during the flight, I couldn't resist the urge to see how they worked. I grabbed one and pulled the trigger, expecting a simple demonstration. But what happened next was far from what I anticipated.

As soon as I activated the life vest, a loud noise echoed through the cabin, startling everyone on board. The sudden silence that followed was deafening. The air hostess shot us a stern look, and my older sister, who was sitting beside me, received a scolding for allowing my curiosity to get the better of me. In that moment, I realized the consequences of my actions and how they could have been much worse.

Despite the fright and scolding, the incident taught me a valuable lesson about curiosity and responsibility. Sometimes, our curiosity can lead us into unexpected situations, but it's important to consider the consequences before acting impulsively. Looking back, I can laugh about it now, but in the moment, it was a sobering reminder that even innocent actions can have serious repercussions.
