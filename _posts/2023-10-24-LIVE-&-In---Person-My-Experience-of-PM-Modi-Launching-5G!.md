To experience first-hand our honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi Ji, along with giants like Mukesh Ambani and Sunil Bharti Mittal to launch 5G services in India was a completely different feel and a very proud moment to witness live. I have included here some video recordings of the same.

Although it has been over a year now that I attended this event, I found it more relevant to talk about it today - when more and more people have access to and a better understanding of 5G.

It was a pleasure to attend India Mobile Congress 2022 live at the newly inaugurated Pragati Maidan, New Delhi on October 1, 2022. The summit was primarily organised to officially mark the beginning of 5G services in India. What a mammoth of an event it was to mark another golden milestone in Indian history. On top of it, to see Mr. Mukesh Ambani and Mr. Sunil Bharti Mittal live and together was also a completely different feeling.

To enter Pragati Maidan on that day was in itself a very pressing task - so many security fixtures, so many checkpoints and ultimate frisking. But, the trouble and wait was worth-it! I got to learn so much about mobile networking technology through the technology booths of companies like Jio, Airtel, Vi (Vodafone-Idea). I even saw a real hologram that day - really amazing. I have even included a video link for the same.

> And I even got to learn that whenever you attend an event where the PM is about to come, you cannot carry headphones (which I was carrying) and sadly, I had to throw them away.

The event took place and everything went very smoothly. It got over in not more than an hour. Additionally, being a technical volunteer, I handled and overviewed local live video production and broadcast, and I even got to taste the amazing food. To top it all, I must complement the amazing arrangement of the management team at Pragati Maidan for flawlessly carrying out everything.
And of course, as always, PM Modi's speech was flawless and had the crowd cheering up for him. 

It was a real pleasure attending IMC 2022.
