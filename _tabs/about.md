## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

Hey there! I'm Devansh Rastogi, a passionate basketball enthusiast and a tech-freak. When I'm not dunking code, you'll find me shooting hoops on the basketball court or cheering for my favorite team. I think it's important to master the basics to achieve big things, and I use this idea when I face challenges. I prefer to keep things simple. Apart from my tech interests, I also keep up with world events and how technology affects the world.
<!--I like to work in solitude as well as in team/groups but I think that progress happens in solitude - when your are just with yourself -->

I have always tried to extend my theoretical knowledge to practical experience. I've been playing around with Arduino and Raspberry Pi's since the age of 14 - learning, applying, breaking, fixing, un-learning, re-learning and everything in between. Apart from this, I have been actively engaged with networking components such as unmanaged and managed switches, CAT5/6 cables, routers, and access points, and networking protocols like RTMP that I have used for local live video and audio streaming. Whether it's configuring network devices or setting up local media servers at home for seamless multi-device access, I am driven by the curiosity to explore the capabilities of interconnected systems.

### Curiosity Can Land You Into Jail!

*When I was around 10 or 11 years old, during my flight to Malaysia, I felt a strong curiosity about inflating my life vest. Ignoring the potential consequences, I activated the compressed air canister, causing a loud noise that startled everyone onboard, leading to a sudden silence. The air hostess gave us a stern look and reprimanded my elder sister, who was seated beside me, for allowing me to tamper with the life vest. She even warned that such actions, if done by an adult, could lead to serious consequences, perhaps even jail time. It's a humorous reminder that curiosity, if not handled with caution, can lead to unexpected outcomes!*

### Crashing Into Success

*On the day of my driving test, disaster struck as I crashed my car into a lamp-post just moments before the exam was scheduled to begin. The rear bumper was left hanging precariously, and the car emitted an alarming noise. Despite my nerves, I decided to proceed with the test. Much to my surprise, not only did I manage to complete the test, but I also passed it with flying cars, uh, oh! I mean flying colours, of course!*
