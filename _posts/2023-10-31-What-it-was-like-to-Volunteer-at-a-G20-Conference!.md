Being in a college gives you so many opportunities to interact and network with the world around you. With the G20 Summit in India in 2023, students from around the country got the chance to get a complete one of a kind experience. 

I feel very proud and fortunate enough to inform all of you that I got a chance to liaison at one of the major technology conferences of G20 Summit India - G20 Conference On Crime And Security In The Age of NFTs, AI And Metaverse.

The conference emphasised the importance of preventing the use of ICTs by state and non-state actors for terrorist purposes. It also highlighted the need for international cooperation, sharing of information, and mutual legal assistance to combat cybercrime effectively. Transparent and accountable governance frameworks for AI were also discussed. The conference stressed the need for an open, secure, and peaceful ICT environment, protecting individuals, especially women and children, from online exploitation. The importance of countering advanced persistent threats and establishing comprehensive international conventions on ICT crimes was also emphasised.

I must accept that it was a completely distinctive experience for me to be with the world leaders - to see them in person and to learn from them. You get to learn so many things from them - their way of talking, their way of presenting, their way of defending themselves against allegations put on them and many other minute but important details. Primary was the august presence of our honourable Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Union Electronics and Information Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw. 

> Addressing the valedictory session, Union Electronics and Information Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said, cyber-attacks are posing serious and complex challenges at every level. Exhorting on global cooperation, he said, efforts must be taken to increase cyber awareness and frame robust rules and digital infrastructure to protect individuals, organisations and society.

During the conference, delegates from G20 countries, invitee countries, international organisations, and other participants discussed various subjects including Internet Governance - Digital Public Infrastructure, Extended Reality, Metaverse, Artificial Intelligence, the Dark Net and Cryptocurrency Challenges, and Criminal Use of Information and Communication Technologies.

On top of it all, I had a great experience being a liaison officer with other students from esteemed institutions like IIT Madras. Our primary role was to liaise between two or more organisations to communicate and coordinate their activities on a matter of mutual concern. And not to mention, I made so many friends and got to know so much about each other. But, as always is the case with me, I enjoyed the food the most :p
